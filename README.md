## Inventory: A way to easily keep track of the items that you have in your house.

Made to hone my Ruby on Rails knowledge. This Rails app uses a database structure so that users will be able to log in the stuff that they have around their house so that just in case there is ever a natural disaster they will have an inventory of their belongings so that they can present it to their insurance. This uses mysqlite for the database work that is packaged in Rails, Bootstrap for the styling of the website and finally it uses embedded Ruby so that correct information is retrieved from the database and displayed on the website. For now it is still in developmet, but I'm hoping to have something up and running very soon.
